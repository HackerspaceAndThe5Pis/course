##### Installing
```sh
cd
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adafruit/Raspberry-Pi-Installer-Scripts/master/retrogame.sh >retrogame.sh
sudo bash retrogame.sh
```

- Pick control configuration 3 (six buttons and joystick)

- The script then downloads and installs the retrogame executable (/usr/local/bin/retrogame) and configuration file (/boot/retrogame.cfg), then performs some administration tasks…/etc/rc.local is amended to make retrogame launch on startup, and a “udev rule” file (/etc/udev/rules.d/10-retrogame.rules) is generated to help it simulate a keyboard.

- Reboot when prompted
